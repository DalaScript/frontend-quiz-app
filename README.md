### What I learned

I can say that this was one of the larger projects I’ve worked on, and it was quite labor-intensive.
What I did for the first time and found to be a great experience were the dark mode implementation and the progress bar.
I wouldn’t say they were very difficult, but they did take a bit more time to complete.

### Continued development

I have already completed two JavaScript courses on freeCodeCamp, and I am currently taking the Front End Development Libraries course, where I’ve finished Bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass, and I’m now working through React.

Alongside this, I am working on projects and following a learning path on Frontendmentor.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - He is my hero, if I need something fast, if I can't understand something, or if I can't find it on the internet, I always ask him.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
